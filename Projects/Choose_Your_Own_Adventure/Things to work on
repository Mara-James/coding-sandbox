## make a setter and getter prop to set interaction options for user
# 
# #### optional respopnse trees dependent on values in inventory and team. These result in 0 hp change and if they do
    #### do not have responses and instead just remove responses, they will only remove one response each. they also build
    #### on each other so they will each remove perish unless used with the other option(team or invenotry respectfully)
    #### in which case they will combine and remove both wound 3 and perish options


### consider making these functions part of a different class or function tree
    #inventory options
    # def item_use(self,current_user_inventory):
    #     current_user_inventory
    #     print("item use")    
    # def item_hint(self,current_user_inventory):
    #     current_user_inventory
    #     print("item hint")
    # #team options
    # def team_aid(self, team):
    #     team
    #     print("aid") 
    # def team_hint(self, team):
    #     team
    #     print("team hint")
      team= "none"
