Goals:
    - to have a library of Mad libs that are randomly generated based on which genre you choose
    - to allow users to choose between 5 different genres
    - to allow users to choose to have pregenerated words or to use their own
    - to make lists of words (n,adj,v,adv) for users to chose from when making prompts ( ideally in large enough 
      quantity that the lists can be randomized between each run of the program)
    - use less if-else statements and more object oriented programming

Stretch Goals:
    - to create a python library that allows the program to call a random set of words with Noun, Adj, Verb and Adv 
      monikers attactched to them, stripped of all definitions, and logged into a tuple. 
    - each word may then be called, when spelled correctly to search the definition of the word.
    - to have a working program that can be deployed into a web application, single page website

 Todo List:
    [] Manually Generate 5 madlib blank prompts for each of the 5 generes 
    [] Create Functionality to call Multipule Choice pre-generated word "Tables" for user if Multiple Choice
       status is active, consider making multiple choice option togglabel throughout program usage.
    [] Create Selectable Word options for Multiple Choice word tables
    [] Develop feature to randomly generate prompts based on genere selection and M.C status toggle
    
Stetch Todo List:
    [] Locate a publicly available english dictionary to convert to data
    [] Create Funtion to convert English Dictionary to usable data (ie useable words only)
    [] Create Function to Sort E.D. data into tuples (they run faster than lists) separated by 
       Noun, Adjective, Verb, Adverb
    [] Create Function to call a random selection of 6 words from E.D word tuples
    [] Create Functionality to call words attached to definitions based on user word input
    [] Web Application Goals and To-dos to be evaluated upon completion of initial goal completion
